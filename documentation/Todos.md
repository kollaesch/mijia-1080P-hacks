# Todos

* [ ] improve general **documentation**
    * details for opening and disassembling of the cam (better pictures)
    * how to install 'tools'
* [ ] provide alternative startup-script that starts/restarts all services so that cam-services can be accessed by Mi-app
* [ ] **kernel-config** available?
Is a `/proc/config*` available on the cam? Would us enable to bring in a customer kernel later.
