# mijia-1080P-hacks

## Goal of this project

Current hacks (see later links) for IP-Cams didn't cover the following ones. Therefor it is the goal of this project to cover Mijia 1080p and Mijia 720p.

* Mijia 1080p ([detailed Review with Pictures and comments](http://www.jayceooi.com/mijia-1080p-ip-camera-review/))
* Mijia 720p ([pictures at a possible buying source for identification](https://www.banggood.com/XIAOMI-MIJIA-360-Degree-720P-Night-Vision-Camera-Motion-Detection-Two-Way-Audio-Pan-Tilt-IR-Camera-p-1169623.html))

The findings on the way can be found in the documentation section of this repo.
(like mechanical disassembly, mainboard-pictures incl. GPIO comments, some steps of the reverse engineering)

The next open items are listed in the [todos](documentation/Todos.md).
